# InFentorApps
InFenTor is a mobile app designed to address the lack of understanding of children's intelligence types in Indonesia. Many children struggle with determining their potential careers and choosing a role model. In response to these challenges, InFenTor offers a solution by providing a user-friendly application to measure children's intelligence types and identify potential careers. The app utilizes a basis of multiple intelligences developed by Howard Gardner.

Using the app is simple: children answer intelligence-related questions, and the application generates personalized results. These results include the child's intelligence type, potential career paths, and famous figures who share the same career, serving as role models.
